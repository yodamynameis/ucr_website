## üì¶ What is Arduino?

Arduino is a microcontroller development board designed to make it easier to interface hardware with software. It allows you to read inputs ‚Äì like light from a sensor or a finger on a button ‚Äì and turn them into outputs ‚Äì activating a motor, turning on an LED, or publishing data online.

Arduino comes with its own IDE (Integrated Development Environment), where you write code in a simplified version of C/C++. This code is then uploaded to the microcontroller on the board via USB.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### ‚úÖ What You Need:
- An Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano)
- USB cable
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Components like LEDs, resistors, sensors
- Arduino IDE (download from <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arduino.cc</a>)


### üîå Setup Steps:
1. **Install the Arduino IDE.**
2. **Connect your Arduino board** to your PC using the USB cable.
3. **Select the correct board and COM port** from \`Tools > Board\` and \`Tools > Port\`.
4. **Write your first sketch**
